Each folder in this repository represents a different assignment designed to help build foundational Java programming skills. The assignments focus on object-oriented programming, algorithm design, and the use of core Java libraries. 

### Key Methods and Tools Used:
1. **Java OOP Principles:**
   - We extensively used object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
   - Classes, interfaces, and abstract methods were implemented to demonstrate these principles.

2. **Sorting Algorithms:**
   - Bubble sort was utilized for sorting data in some assignments, particularly with string arrays.
   
3. **Input/Output Operations:**
   - The projects involve reading input from the user and writing to files using Javaâ€™s `Scanner` and `FileWriter` classes.

4. **Version Control:**
   - All assignments were committed and versioned using Git and GitHub, ensuring organized and trackable project updates.

### Development Environment:
- **IDE:** Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub.
